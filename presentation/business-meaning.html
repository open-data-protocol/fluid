                                    <p>Business users were often seen as the last step in the data chain. You received a report or a data export and had little say in how it was created or if it truly met your needs.</p>
                                    <div class="shock-value">Data was something that was "done to you." This led to a disconnect where the technical teams built what they thought you needed, not what you actually needed.</div>
                                    <h3>The New Reality: An Active Stakeholder</h3>
                                    <p>Data Product thinking puts the business user at the center. Your needs, questions, and expertise are the driving force behind what gets built. You are a critical partner in the data creation process.</p>
                                    <h3>Your Responsibilities and Superpowers:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Define "Value":</strong> Your primary role is to articulate the business problems that need solving. This directly informs which Data Products get prioritized and built.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Provide Feedback:</strong> The Marketplace allows you to rate Data Products and provide direct feedback to the owners. This creates a continuous improvement loop.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Become a Data Product Owner:</strong> As a subject matter expert in your domain, you are the ideal candidate to become the official owner of a Data Product, guiding its strategy and ensuring it meets the needs of your peers.</li>
