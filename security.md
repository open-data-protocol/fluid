# FLUID Security Best Practices

## Secret Management
- Use environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to store sensitive information like API keys and credentials.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in `.fluid.yml` files.

## Data Encryption
- Ensure that data in transit is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
- Use encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in data warehouses or lakes.

## Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage who can access which data products.
- Use FLUID's access policies to define fine-grained access control.

## Compliance
- Ensure that FLUID implementations comply with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
- Maintain audit logs for all data access and modifications.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Set up monitoring for FLUID workflows to detect anomalies or security breaches.
- Log all activities related to data products for auditing purposes.

This document will be updated with more detailed security guidelines as the project evolves.
